# React News

Working through a variety of tutorials and my own working knowledge of React, I wanted to write a simple blog posting type app. Currently it is set up to connect to a Rails API and can get, post and delete articles. Exercises in higher order components, react-router amongst others were practised whilst writing this app.

Rails API can be found [here](https://github.com/LondonJim/Rails-API-for-React-News)

## Available Scripts

Set up all the dependencies:

#### `npm install`

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner. Currently all tests are written with Jest/Enzyme

## Notes

Currently there is no authorisation on the API calls and is only set up for local use.
